#   Project

##  Strategy/Scope
PowerCamp website aims to provide essential information about the available camps and its offer to the user in a clear and visually pleasing way. It targets families looking for information about our Youth Programs
<br>
 The content is presented on scrolling page with sections dedicated to categorised informations. The <b>primary objective</b> is to encourage sign-ups by leading them to the contact form. 
<br>

To achieve the strategy goals I implemented following features:
* simple website layout with a menu bar sticked to the top of the viewport for easy navigation,  
* informative  "Camps" and FAQ's sections, 
* multiple call-to-action buttons across the whole page,  
* a contact form   
* consistent images across the whole page to immerse the user in Site Owner's story. 
<br>
